This is the crown jewel of my projects, I've been building it for over a year now. And it's safe to say this project made me learn so much stuff about both frontend and backend technologies. I started this project from scratch and it grew over time, as I grew with it. It's still in development mode (some things might not work as expected).

This web-app is build for the European organization for young people Erasmus+, it allows NGO organization which are hosting projects all over Europe, to publish them here, with all the necessary information in a well organized way.

It also has a search page where students and young people can easily find the exact project they are looking for.

It uses prisma2 as a database, and with a nodeJS express server and a graphql API, dataflow is superfast.

On the frontend I'm using a server(pre)-rendered approach using NextJS, which allows the app to be SEO friendly and highly performant
